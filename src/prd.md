  - White text on accent green (celebration moments)
  - Dark charcoal on light backgrounds (main reading text)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for simplicity and consistency
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headers, medium subheaders, regular body text with clear size differences
- **Font Personality**: Modern, friendly, trustworthy - Inter's humanist qualities feel approachable yet professional
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line spacing (1.5x), optimal reading widths, sufficient size contrast
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent spacing system, predictable hierarchy patterns
- **Which fonts**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700 weights)
- **Legibility Check**: Inter excels in both desktop and mobile contexts with excellent character distinction

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Center-focused layouts with clear primary actions, subtle animations guide eye movement
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous margins create premium feel and reduce cognitive load
- **Grid System**: Center-aligned content blocks with consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design that scales up gracefully, maintaining usability across devices
- **Content Density**: Spacious layouts that let individual choices breathe and feel important

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions show cause-and-effect relationships, celebration animations reward completion
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Choice selection gets immediate feedback, eliminated items fade gracefully, winner gets prominent celebration
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Subtle hover states for exploration, decisive animation for choices, joyful celebration for completion

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for choices (tactile feeling), Buttons for actions (clear CTAs), Progress bars for advancement tracking
- **Component Customization**: Rounded corners for friendly feel, hover states for interactivity, color variations for different action types
- **Component States**: Clear hover, active, and selected states for all interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor Icons - Play for start, Trophy for winners, Repeat for restart, Gift for presentation
- **Component Hierarchy**: Large choice cards as primary elements, smaller status indicators as secondary

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Users might want to see eliminated items, might want to restart mid-game, might want different item sets
- **Edge Case Handling**: Clear restart option available at any time, eliminated items tracked but hidden, single curated set keeps experience focused
- **Technical Constraints**: Local storage limitations handled through KV system, state persistence across browser refreshes

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Could expand to multiple item categories or user-generated lists
- **Testing Focus**: Elimination logic correctness, state persistence, mobile interaction quality
- **Critical Questions**: Do users complete the full elimination? Do they feel satisfied with results? Do they replay?

## Reflection
This approach uniquely combines the satisfaction of tournament-style elimination with lifestyle aspiration, creating an engaging way to discover preferences. The curated item list removes setup friction while ensuring quality choices. The smart algorithm ensures meaningful final comparisons between true preferences.

Key assumptions: Users prefer guided discovery over open-ended customization, elimination creates stronger preference clarity than ranking, lifestyle items create emotional engagement that drives completion.

What makes this exceptional: The combination of smart pairing logic, elimination tracking, and celebration experience creates a complete preference discovery journey rather than just a simple voting mechanism.
